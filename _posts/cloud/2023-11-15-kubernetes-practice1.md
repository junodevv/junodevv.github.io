## 쿠버네티스 클러스터 구성

kubeadm으로 클러스터 생성하기
- 마스터 노드에서 실습
- kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=<value> --apiserver-advertise-address=<master node의 private ip>
        여기서 뒤에는 생략해도됨

```shell
#플라넬 권장 아이피 10.244.0.0/16
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```
        - init: 클러스터 생성

Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
	timed out waiting for the condition

This error is likely caused by:
	- The kubelet is not running
	- The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
	- 'systemctl status kubelet'
	- 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI.
Here is one example how you may list all running Kubernetes containers by using crictl:
	- 'crictl --runtime-endpoint unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
	Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
	- 'crictl --runtime-endpoint unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock logs CONTAINERID'
error execution phase wait-control-plane: couldn't initialize a Kubernetes cluster
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
